# Number Baseball Helper

* Purpose of this tool
  * Help players solving so-called _Number Baseball_ game.



* Why did I start this project ?

  I had a chance to get some gifts in a event ㅑㄹ I solve this game as fast as I possible. But it was a little bit hard to think about possible cases in my head. So I think it would be good if this kind of tool exists. And just for fun.
